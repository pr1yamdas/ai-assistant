Voice-Activated Assistant with Python
Overview
This project implements a simple voice-activated assistant using Python. The assistant, named Jarvis, leverages the speech_recognition library for speech-to-text and the win32com library for text-to-speech. It can recognize spoken commands, respond to queries, and perform actions such as opening websites.

Features
Speech Recognition: Utilizes the speech_recognition library to capture and transcribe speech from the user.
Text-to-Speech: Uses the win32com library to convert text responses to spoken words.
Website Interaction: Opens specified websites based on user commands.
User Interaction: Prompts the user for input and responds accordingly.
Dependencies
speech_recognition: A library for performing speech recognition in Python.
pywin32: Provides Python extensions for Windows, including access to Windows Speech API (SAPI).
