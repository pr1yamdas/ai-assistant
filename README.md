## Features

- **Speech Recognition:** The system recognizes spoken commands using the SpeechRecognition library.
- **Natural Language Processing:** Leverages OpenAI's GPT-3 model for natural language understanding and generation.
- **Voice Synthesis:** Utilizes the pyttsx3 library for text-to-speech synthesis.
- **Adaptation:** The AI adapts and learns from user interactions, enhancing its responses over time.
