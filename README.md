# Voice-Controlled AI Assistant



## Overview

Welcome to the Voice-Controlled AI Assistant project! This project implements a voice-activated artificial intelligence assistant capable of understanding user commands, providing responses, and adapting over time based on user interactions.

## Features

- **Speech Recognition:** The system recognizes spoken commands using the SpeechRecognition library.
- **Natural Language Processing:** Leverages OpenAI's GPT-3 model for natural language understanding and generation.
- **Voice Synthesis:** Utilizes the pyttsx3 library for text-to-speech synthesis.
- **Adaptation:** The AI adapts and learns from user interactions, enhancing its responses over time.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (specified in requirements.txt)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pr1yamdas/ai-assistant.git
