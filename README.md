# Voice-Activated AI Assistant with Python

## Overview

This project implements a simple voice-activated assistant using Python. The assistant, named Jarvis, leverages the `speech_recognition` library for speech-to-text and the `win32com` library for text-to-speech. It can recognize spoken commands, respond to queries, and perform actions such as opening websites.

## Features

- **Speech Recognition:** Utilizes the `speech_recognition` library to capture and transcribe speech from the user.
- **Text-to-Speech:** Uses the `win32com` library to convert text responses to spoken words.
- **Website Interaction:** Opens specified websites based on user commands.
- **User Interaction:** Prompts the user for input and responds accordingly.

## Dependencies

- [speech_recognition](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/): A library for performing speech recognition in Python.
- [pywin32](https://pypi.org/project/pywin32/): Provides Python extensions for Windows, including access to Windows Speech API (SAPI).
